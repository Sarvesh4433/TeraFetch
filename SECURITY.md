## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of TeraFetch seriously. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please report it to us as described below.

### How to Report

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them via email to: [security@terafetch.dev](mailto:security@terafetch.dev)

If you prefer, you can also create a private security advisory on GitHub:
1. Go to the [Security tab](https://github.com/your-username/terafetch/security)
2. Click "Report a vulnerability"
3. Fill out the form with details

### What to Include

Please include the following information in your report:

- Type of issue (e.g., buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
- The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

### Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: We will acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report within 48 hours
- **Assessment**: We will assess the vulnerability and determine its severity within 5 business days
- **Resolution**: We will work to resolve confirmed vulnerabilities as quickly as possible:
  - Critical: Within 7 days
  - High: Within 14 days
  - Medium: Within 30 days
  - Low: Within 60 days

### Disclosure Policy

- We will coordinate with you to determine an appropriate disclosure timeline
- We will credit you in our security advisory (unless you prefer to remain anonymous)
- We will notify users of security updates through our release notes and security advisories

## Security Measures

TeraFetch implements several security measures:

### Code Security
- **Static Analysis**: Automated security scanning with CodeQL
- **Dependency Scanning**: Regular dependency vulnerability checks
- **Code Review**: All changes undergo security-focused code review
- **Secure Coding**: Following Go security best practices

### Runtime Security
- **Input Validation**: Strict validation of all user inputs and URLs
- **Memory Safety**: Go's memory safety features prevent common vulnerabilities
- **Secure Defaults**: Secure configuration defaults
- **Minimal Privileges**: Runs with minimal required permissions

### Network Security
- **TLS Verification**: Proper certificate validation for all HTTPS connections
- **URL Validation**: Whitelist-based URL validation for supported domains
- **Proxy Security**: Secure proxy authentication and connection handling
- **No Credential Persistence**: Authentication data is not stored persistently

### Authentication Security
- **Cookie Security**: Secure handling of authentication cookies
- **No Logging**: Sensitive data is never logged
- **Memory Cleanup**: Automatic cleanup of sensitive data from memory
- **Bypass Safety**: Authentication bypass methods don't expose credentials

## Security Best Practices for Users

### Safe Usage
- **Verify Downloads**: Always verify the integrity of downloaded binaries
- **Use HTTPS**: Only download from official HTTPS sources
- **Keep Updated**: Regularly update to the latest version
- **Secure Storage**: Store authentication cookies securely

### Cookie Security
- **Limited Scope**: Only use cookies for their intended purpose
- **Secure Storage**: Store cookie files with appropriate file permissions
- **Regular Rotation**: Regularly refresh authentication cookies
- **Clean Removal**: Securely delete cookie files when no longer needed

### Network Security
- **Trusted Networks**: Use TeraFetch on trusted networks when possible
- **Proxy Verification**: Verify proxy servers before use
- **Monitor Traffic**: Be aware of network traffic when downloading

## Vulnerability Disclosure Examples

### What We Consider Security Issues
- Remote code execution
- Authentication bypass
- Privilege escalation
- Information disclosure of sensitive data
- Denial of service attacks
- Injection vulnerabilities

### What We Don't Consider Security Issues
- Issues requiring physical access to the user's machine
- Social engineering attacks
- Issues in third-party dependencies (report to the respective maintainers)
- Rate limiting bypasses (these are expected functionality)
