# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The CI/CD pipeline for TeraFetch is currently failing due to multiple issues including race conditions in tests, deprecated golangci-lint linters, incorrect output format configurations, and missing platform-specific build artifacts. This spec addresses the comprehensive fixes needed to ensure a robust, reliable CI/CD pipeline that generates all required platform-specific binaries and passes all quality checks.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Fix Race Conditions in Tests

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all tests to pass with race detection enabled so that the codebase is thread-safe and reliable in concurrent environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running tests with `-race` flag THEN all tests SHALL pass without data race warnings
2. WHEN multiple goroutines access shared variables in tests THEN access SHALL be protected by appropriate synchronization primitives
3. WHEN TestCompleteDownloadWorkflow runs THEN requestCount and rangeRequests variables SHALL be accessed in a thread-safe manner
4. WHEN concurrent HTTP requests are made in tests THEN shared state SHALL be protected with mutexes
5. IF race conditions are detected THEN the CI pipeline SHALL fail until fixed

### Requirement 2: Fix golangci-lint Configuration Issues

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the linting process to run without errors or warnings so that code quality is maintained and the CI pipeline passes successfully.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN golangci-lint runs THEN it SHALL NOT report deprecated linter warnings
2. WHEN linting configuration is processed THEN deprecated linters (shadow, deadcode, structcheck, varcheck, maligned) SHALL be removed
3. WHEN output format is configured THEN it SHALL use supported format options
4. WHEN linting test files THEN appropriate exclusions SHALL be applied for test-specific patterns
5. IF unknown linters are specified THEN the configuration SHALL be updated to remove them

### Requirement 3: Ensure Cross-Platform Build Generation

**User Story:** As a user, I want platform-specific binaries available for my operating system so that I can run TeraFetch without compilation requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN CI pipeline runs THEN binaries SHALL be generated for Linux (amd64, arm64)
2. WHEN CI pipeline runs THEN binaries SHALL be generated for macOS (amd64, arm64)  
3. WHEN CI pipeline runs THEN binaries SHALL be generated for Windows (amd64, arm64)
4. WHEN CI pipeline runs THEN binaries SHALL be generated for FreeBSD (amd64)
5. WHEN release is created THEN all platform binaries SHALL be attached as artifacts
6. WHEN Windows binaries are built THEN they SHALL have .exe extension
7. WHEN binaries are built THEN they SHALL be optimized with appropriate ldflags

### Requirement 4: Improve CI/CD Pipeline Reliability

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the CI/CD pipeline to be reliable and provide clear feedback so that I can quickly identify and fix issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN CI pipeline runs THEN it SHALL complete all jobs successfully
2. WHEN tests fail THEN the pipeline SHALL provide clear error messages
3. WHEN linting fails THEN specific issues SHALL be highlighted
4. WHEN builds fail THEN compilation errors SHALL be clearly reported
5. WHEN artifacts are generated THEN they SHALL be properly uploaded and accessible
6. IF any job fails THEN dependent jobs SHALL be skipped appropriately

### Requirement 5: Optimize Build Performance

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the CI/CD pipeline to run efficiently so that feedback is provided quickly and resources are used optimally.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Go modules are downloaded THEN they SHALL be cached between runs
2. WHEN builds run THEN Go build cache SHALL be utilized
3. WHEN multiple platform builds run THEN they SHALL execute in parallel
4. WHEN dependencies are verified THEN the process SHALL be optimized
5. IF cache is available THEN it SHALL be restored before downloading dependencies

### Requirement 6: Ensure Test Coverage and Quality

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive test coverage reporting so that I can maintain code quality and identify untested areas.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests run THEN coverage SHALL be calculated and reported
2. WHEN coverage is generated THEN it SHALL be uploaded to Codecov
3. WHEN tests run THEN they SHALL include race detection
4. WHEN test files are linted THEN appropriate exclusions SHALL apply
5. IF coverage drops significantly THEN it SHALL be flagged for review

### Requirement 7: Fix Go Version Compatibility

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the CI/CD pipeline to use the correct Go version so that builds are consistent and compatible.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN CI pipeline runs THEN it SHALL use Go 1.25.x (latest stable)
2. WHEN go.mod is updated THEN CI SHALL use compatible Go version
3. WHEN new Go features are used THEN CI SHALL support them
4. WHEN builds run THEN Go version SHALL be consistent across all jobs
5. IF Go version is outdated THEN it SHALL be updated appropriately

### Requirement 8: Enhance Release Process

**User Story:** As a maintainer, I want automated releases with proper artifacts so that users can easily access new versions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a version tag is pushed THEN a release SHALL be automatically created
2. WHEN release is created THEN all platform binaries SHALL be attached
3. WHEN changelog exists THEN relevant sections SHALL be included in release notes
4. WHEN release is created THEN it SHALL include proper metadata
5. IF tag contains pre-release indicators THEN release SHALL be marked as prerelease
